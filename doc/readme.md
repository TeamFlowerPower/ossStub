# Requirements

# Process

# Limitations

# Usage

# Command Line Arguments
Give an extended description (if needed) so some command line arguments. **Do not repeat yourself what is already explained in `--help`.** You could even separate between optional and required arguments.
# Project Configuration

## Formal definition
## Configuration Files

# Output files

# Terminology
When you introduce specific terms explain this here. Sometimes it is worth to do this in a spearate file.

# Examples

# Technical Details
The information given here is mainly relevant for developers. If it is to long move it to a separate file an reference from here.

It is always a good idea to include call graphs and UML class diagrams to help others to get a better understanding of the software.
