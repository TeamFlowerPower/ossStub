# Example project

This folder (or multiple) should contain a **readme** telling the user the purpose of your work with the help of an example project. In my opinion this is the most direct entry point to get to know some open source project.

No one wants to read a long and formal documentation - however it is important to have one for reference.

Consider the following points:

1. What does the example project show?
1. What do I have to do to run it?
1. Attach and show how results/output would look like (if the amount of data is not to big enclose it with the example)
